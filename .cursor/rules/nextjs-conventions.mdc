# Next.js Development Guide

This project uses Next.js with the App Router.

Key conventions and files:

-   **App Router**: Located in `src/app/`.
    -   Pages are defined by `page.tsx` (or `.js`, `.jsx`) files within route segments (directories).
    -   Layouts are defined by `layout.tsx` files and apply to child segments.
    -   Loading UI is defined by `loading.tsx` files.
    -   Error UI is defined by `error.tsx` files.
    -   Route Handlers (API routes) are typically in `src/app/api/.../route.ts`.
-   **Public Assets**: Static assets are served from the `public/` directory. For example, `public/image.png` is accessible at `/image.png`.
-   **Configuration**: Next.js specific configurations are in `next.config.ts` ([next.config.ts](mdc:next.config.ts)).
-   **TypeScript**: The project uses TypeScript, configured via `tsconfig.json` ([tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)). Type declarations for Next.js are in `next-env.d.ts` ([next-env.d.ts](mdc:next-env.d.ts)).

For more details on Next.js conventions, refer to the official Next.js documentation.
