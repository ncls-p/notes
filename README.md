**Noteworthy** is a next-generation, self-hosted note-taking application designed for privacy-conscious individuals and teams who want to leverage the power of AI _on their own terms_. Bring your own AI models (OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, Azure OpenAI, etc.), chat with your documents using advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), transcribe voice notes effortlessly, and collaborate in real-time, all while maintaining full ownership of your data. Secure, flexible, and powerful ‚Äì Noteworthy aims to be the ultimate personal and collaborative knowledge management system.

- ü§ù **Real-Time Collaboration:** Edit notes simultaneously with presence indicators (powered by Yjs).
- üîó **Granular Sharing & Permissions:** Public links, invite registered users with view/edit access.
- ü§ñ **User-Configurable AI:** Connect YOUR OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, Azure, or any OpenAI-compatible LLM.
- üí¨ **Contextual AI Chat (RAG):** Chat _with your notes_ using your chosen LLMs and embedding models.
- üé§ **Voice-to-Text Transcription:** Record voice notes and transcribe them using your chosen AI service.
- üîç **Powerful Search:** Keyword-based full-text search and semantic search capabilities.
- üí∏ **Optional AI Cost Tracking:** Monitor token usage for your configured AI services (provider-dependent).
- üåê **Offline Mode:** Basic note-taking (CRUD) and viewing even when offline, with automatic synchronization upon reconnection.
- ÌõÖ **Webhooks:** Trigger external actions based on configurable note events (e.g., `note.created`, `note.updated`).
- üõ°Ô∏è **Built for Security:** Emphasis on HTTPS, strong password hashing (Argon2id), encrypted API keys, and resilience against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

A modern, robust, and type-safe stack:

- üíª **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, CodeMirror 6, Yjs, Zustand/Jotai.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Backend:** Node.js, Fastify, TypeScript, Prisma (ORM), Langchain.js, Yjs, Argon2id (hashing).
- üóÑÔ∏è **Database:** PostgreSQL (16+) with the `pgvector` extension for efficient similarity search.
- üê≥ **Deployment:** Docker Compose for easy, multi-container setup.
- üìä **Observability:** Structured Logging (Pino), Prometheus-compatible Metrics, OpenTelemetry Tracing.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Noteworthy employs a microservice-oriented architecture, containerized with Docker. The core idea is that _you_ provide and manage your AI model integrations, ensuring data privacy and cost control.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["User's Browser (Client)"] -- HTTP/S, WebSocket --> B["nginx-proxy (Reverse Proxy, Optional)"]

    subgraph "Docker Network (Managed by docker-compose)"
        B -- HTTP/S (Frontend & API), WSS (Collaboration) --> C["nextjs-app (Combined Frontend & Backend Container)"]

        C -- SQL Queries --> E["postgres (DB Container with pgvector)"]

        subgraph "User-Provided AI Integration"
            C -- Retrieves User's AI Config (from DB) --> E
            E -- Encrypted API Keys & Config --> C
            C -- Decrypts & Uses Config --> F["External AI Service (OpenAI, User's Ollama, Groq, etc.)"]
        end
    end
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

Get your Noteworthy instance up and running with these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- (Optional) Node.js & npm/yarn/pnpm for local development outside Docker.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ncls-p/notes.git
    cd notes
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    The application requires several environment variables for configuration (database credentials, security keys, etc.). We use a `.env` file for this.
    A `docker-compose.yml` is provided, and it expects a `.env` file in the project root.
    _You'll need to create this file first._ We recommend copying from `.env.example` (which you should create based on the [Deployment Section of DAT.md](./DAT.md#6-docker-compose-deployment)) if it exists, or create it manually.

    Create a `.env` file at the project root (`./.env`) with variables like:

    ```env
    # General
    NODE_ENV=development # or production
    LOG_LEVEL=info

    # Backend API
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://notesuser:strongnotespassword@postgres:5432/notesdb"
    JWT_SECRET="your_very_strong_jwt_secret_here_at_least_64_chars_long_and_random"
    APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your_strong_32_byte_random_encryption_key_for_aes_256_gcm" # Must be 32 chars

    # Frontend (Ensure these match how Docker services will communicate)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3001/api"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL="ws://localhost:3001"

    # PostgreSQL
    POSTGRES_USER="notesuser"
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD="strongnotespassword"
    POSTGRES_DB="notesdb"
    POSTGRES_PORT="5432" # Host port mapping, if you expose it
    ```

    **‚ö†Ô∏è CRUCIAL SECURITY NOTE:**

    - Generate **cryptographically secure random values** for `JWT_SECRET` and `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
    - For production, use Docker secrets or a dedicated secrets management tool instead of committing `.env` files directly or including them in container images.
    - The `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` **must be exactly 32 characters long** (256 bits) for AES-256 GCM.

### Running the App

1.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    Navigate to the project root directory (where `docker-compose.yml` is located) and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    The `--build` flag ensures images are built if they don't exist or if Dockerfiles change. `-d` runs containers in detached mode.

2.  **Access Noteworthy:**
    Once the services are up (you can check with `docker-compose ps`), open your web browser and navigate to:
    `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured for the `nextjs-app` service if you changed it).
